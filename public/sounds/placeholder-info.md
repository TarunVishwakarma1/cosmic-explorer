# Placeholder Sound Files

These are placeholder silent audio files that allow your game to function without errors while you source or create real sound effects:

1. `engine.mp3` - Silent placeholder for spacecraft engine sound
2. `boost.mp3` - Silent placeholder for boost/acceleration sound
3. `collision.mp3` - Silent placeholder for collision sound
4. `collect.mp3` - Silent placeholder for resource collection sound
5. `background.mp3` - Silent placeholder for background music

## Using Real Sound Files

To replace these placeholders with real sound effects:

1. Download appropriate sound files from the sources mentioned in the main README.md
2. Rename your files exactly as above or update the references in the code
3. Replace these silent placeholder files

## Sound Effect Creation Tools

You can create your own space-themed sound effects with these tools:

- [BFXR](https://www.bfxr.net/) - Synthesize retro game sounds
- [ChipTone](https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone) - Create 8-bit style effects
- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) - Record and edit audio files

## Sound File Optimization

For best performance:
- Keep files under 1MB when possible
- Use MP3 format for good compression
- Set appropriate bitrate (128-192kbps is usually sufficient)
- Trim silence from beginning and end of effects
